The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into sales trends, popular pizza categories, and customer preferences.

Contents
- `pizza_sales.sql`: SQL scripts for data analysis.
- `pizza_sales_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing Python code for data analysis.
- `data.csv`: CSV file containing the pizza sales dataset.

SQL Queries
The `pizza_sales.sql` file contains SQL queries for the following tasks:
- Calculating total revenue.
- Analyzing sales by pizza category and size.
- Identifying top-selling and least-selling pizzas.
- Aggregating sales data by month, day, or hour.

Python Code
The `pizza_sales_analysis.ipynb` notebook includes Python code for the following tasks:
- Loading and preprocessing the pizza sales dataset (`data.csv`).
- Visualizing sales trends using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.
- Exploring correlations between different variables such as order date, pizza category, and total price.
